# Rules Summary

## Winning

- **Dominate** - Control the Methane Sea, Oil Sands and Volcanic Region by having a strong enough presence there that you would [**Repel**](https://github.com/Ellotron/war-rig/tree/main/rules#repel) anyone automatically.
- **War or Peace** - Discover, construct and activate a unique facility in the Planet Core or Deep Space bringing lasting peace or all-consuming war.
- **Annihilate** - Capture and coerce, or kill all other faction squads using a War Rig.

## Squad Actions

Each squad can perform two actions per turn. Actions are summarised below. Most of these cost one action (1). Some actions have no cost and optional (free) or happen automatically at no cost (auto).

### Basic Locations

- [**Move**](https://github.com/Ellotron/war-rig/tree/main/rules#1-move) (1) - move to a [**Basic Location**](https://github.com/Ellotron/war-rig/tree/main/rules#basic-locations). Rival factions may [**Repel**](https://github.com/Ellotron/war-rig/tree/main/rules#repel) you.
- [**Gather**](https://github.com/Ellotron/war-rig/tree/main/rules#2-gather) (1) - collect 1 resource, scrap or tech token available in the location you are in if you have room to carry it.
- [**Encamp**](https://github.com/Ellotron/war-rig/tree/main/rules#3-encampdecamp) (1) - increase the rate at which you gather and your chance to [**Repel**](https://github.com/Ellotron/war-rig/tree/main/rules#repel) rival factions by 1 at the cost of not being able to move.
- [**Decamp**](https://github.com/Ellotron/war-rig/tree/main/rules#3-encampdecamp) (1) - removes bonuses to gather and [**Repel**](https://github.com/Ellotron/war-rig/tree/main/rules#repel) but restores the movement ability.
- [**Attack**](https://github.com/Ellotron/war-rig/tree/main/rules#4-squad-attack) (1) - attack another squad in the same location to make them give up their items and/or to capture them.

### Home base

- [**Deposit**](https://github.com/Ellotron/war-rig/tree/main/rules#deposit) (auto) - store resources you've gathered, swap tech tokens for tech cards and imprison your captives in the cells.
- [**Construct**](https://github.com/Ellotron/war-rig/tree/main/rules#6-construct) (1) - use tools to convert resources into facilities, war-rig tech and equipment you own (or jointly own).
- [**Assign**](https://github.com/Ellotron/war-rig/tree/main/rules#assign) (free) - Add equipment from the inventory to any squads, attach constructed tech to the war-rig chassis, deploy constructed facilities.
- [**Coerce**](https://github.com/Ellotron/war-rig/tree/main/rules#5-coerce) (1) - Reduce the coercion counters on a squad you have captured by 1 to coerce them over to your faction.
- [**Fight Fire**](https://github.com/Ellotron/war-rig/tree/main/rules#7-fight-fire) (1) - Attempt to put out a fire on the war-rig or a facility.

### Rival base

- [**Recruit**](https://github.com/Ellotron/war-rig/tree/main/rules#1-recruit) (1) - attempt to convince a rival squad to be initiated into your faction.
- [**Rescue**](https://github.com/Ellotron/war-rig/tree/main/rules#2-rescue) (1) - attempt to rescue one of your squads that has been recruited or captured.
- [**Espionage**](https://github.com/Ellotron/war-rig/tree/main/rules#3-espionage) (1) - attempt to examine, reveal and/or steal equipment plans or unconstructed tech.
- [**Sabotage**](https://github.com/Ellotron/war-rig/tree/main/rules#4-sabotage) (1) - attempt to cause a fire to break out on a facility or war-rig if it is at home base.

## War Rig Actions

Each war rig can perform two actions per turn. The actions it can perform depend on the type and condition of tech that is attached to it.

- [**Movement**](https://github.com/Ellotron/war-rig/tree/main/rules#movement) - War rigs cannot move into a rival base but cannot be repelled from other locations. They may only move if they have tech attached that is working and allows them to do so.

- [Attack](https://github.com/Ellotron/war-rig/tree/main/rules#attack) - War rigs can attack squads, facilities and other war rigs in the same location as them. In one action a war rig can:

  1. Select one weapon to fire.
  1. Use the [**targeting**](https://github.com/Ellotron/war-rig/tree/main/rules#targeting) ability to lock on to a target.
  1. Roll attack dice, count hits, resolve special effects all according to the card and [**dice type**](https://github.com/Ellotron/war-rig/tree/main/rules#war-rig).
  1. Resolve attack:
     1. Squads defend as in [**Squad Attack**](https://github.com/Ellotron/war-rig/tree/main/rules#4-squad-attack) but cannot surrender and are destroyed instead.
     1. War rigs and facilities deduct armour points until a [**Fire**](https://github.com/Ellotron/war-rig/tree/main/rules#fire) breaks out.
  1. Repeat for additional weapons on the rig.
