# Rules v0.1

## Object

The object of the game is to become the dominant faction. There are 4 ways to do this:

- **Dominate all resources** - control undeniably all 3 resource-rich **Basic Locations**.
- **Peace through power** - tap into abundant, free power in the **Planet Core**.
- **Align with the Empire** - build a warp gate in **Deep Space** to summon the empire.
- **Total Annihilation** - use your War Rig to destroy all other factions.
  Each of these has its own path to completion discussed in **End Game** but you will need to build your War Rig to have a chance to achieve any of them.

## Glossary

### Basic Locations

There are six map locations where basic resources can be gathered
Three tech-rich(T) and three resource-rich (R):

- Ancient City - (T) - known to contain caches of ancient alien tech
- Methane Sea - (R) - an abundant source of chemical materials
- Deep Trenches - (T) - uncover buried tech and access the planet core
- Volcanic Range - (R) - a source of geothermal power and raw materials
- Low Orbit - (T) - find abandoned tech by aerial reconnaissance and access deep space
- Oil Sands - (R) - a rich source of fuel and silicon

### Special Locations

There are various locations for which special rules apply:

- Home Base - your faction's center of operations
- Rival Base - any other base controlled by a player or a **Lesser Faction**
- Planet Core - can only be accessed from Deep Trenches. With the right materials you can construct an infinite power source that will bring a lasting peace.
- Deep Space - can only be accessed from Low Orbit. With the right materials you can construct a warp gate that will bring you an alliance with the empire.
- Barren Wastes - players scavenge for scrap or ambush other players.

### Various

- Lesser Faction - Represent non-player factions that can be more easily recruited to your cause.

## Setup

Place the tech cards and coercion counters where everyone can reach them. Place a supply of coloured resource cubes in near location according to the colours printed in each location.

Decide who will go first, 2nd, 3rd etc and sit by the Home Base with that number. Each player starts with the following:

- 1 empty War Rig chassis in their Home Base
- 3 faction squad boards in their Home Base each with number token (1-3) to identify it.
- 1 set of standard issue equipment cards face up in their play area

Assign equipment to your squads in any order by placing numbered tokens on the equipment card that match the squad you want to equip.
Place your remaining 3 faction squad counters (4-6) in a vacant base. These represent the **Lesser Factions**.

## Order of play

Starting with player 1, each faction squad you control can perform 2 Actions (e.g. movement, gather, attack). Each squad must use both their actions at once or pass. Once you use or pass all the actions of all your squads, play passes to the next player number (e.g. player 1 to 2 to 3 etc). Play repeats in this fashion until one of the **End Game** conditions is met.

## Basic Actions

### 1. Move

Players can move faction squad by using an action. Every Basic Location and Base is reached via crossing the **Barren Wastes**. For example, to reach the Ancient City in one turn would cost 2 actions for a squad: 1 to reach the wastes and then another to reach the city.
**Special Locations** have their own rules regarding movement

#### Repel

You may attempt to enter any basic location or base, but the squads occupying the same area may attempt to repel your squad if both:

1. They have at least double the squads you have in that area (including the one you are moving in)
2. They roll a number equal or less than the number of squads they have in that area on the white dice.

#### Repelled

> A repelled squad moves back to the Barren Wastes losing any remaining actions it may have had. Each player has just one opportunity to repel any movement attempt.

#### Movement with captives

> If a squad is moving with a squad they have **Captured** and they move to a location other than their Home Base or the Barren Wastes then the captured squad **Escape**s. If the captor moves to Home Base the squad is no longer considered captured but they can be **Corece**d.

#### Escape

> If a squad escapes capture remove any coercion counters. They are **Repelled** to either the Barren Wastes or if already there to their Home Base. They keep any items they had when captured.

### 2. Gather

A faction squad can gather resources or tech from a basic location by using 1 action. Take one of the available resource cubes and add it to that squad board on a space in the white resource section. That resource is now carried by the squad that gathered it. If however the squad has no free spaces leave it on the board in that location. Any squad can claim this resource on their turn.

### 3. Encamp/decamp

A faction squad can camp at location by using an action. While a squad is camped, Place a green camp token on their board in the brown site section. This has the following effects:

- The squad's **Gather** actions allow them to gather 1 additional resource
- A squad counts as 2 for the purposes of repel (equipment can further modify this)
- The squad must spend 1 action to decamp (remove the camp token) before they can move

### 4. Squad Attack

A faction squad may attack another squad when they share the same location. However a squad cannot attack when it is infiltrated in a **Rival Base**.
Squads have 1 offence for each friendly faction in the location. This can be further modified by equipment. For every 2 offence your squad has roll 1 red attack dice.
Similarly the defender has a defence of 1 for each friendly squad in the location plus/minus the effect of any equipment. For each 2 defence roll a brown defence dice.
An unequipped squad cannot roll to attack or defend.

### Attack dice symbols

- 🔺️ - Miss: no effect
- 🎯 - One hit
- 🎯🎯 - Two hits
- 🌫 - Overheat: the squads' weapons overheat. The attack is cancelled and the attacking squad cannot participate in any further attacks this turn
- ⚡ - Backfire: the squad's weapons fail. The attack is cancelled and they suffer a hit

### Defence dice symbols

- 🟫 - no effect
- 🛡 - one dodge: negates a hit
- 🛡🛡 - two dodge: negates two hits

For each remaining 🎯 after subtracting each 🛡 resolve a hit. A squad that has been hit can, in this order:

1. Use any equipment carried by a friendly squad in that area that begins "When attacked".
2. If the defender has a captured squad the attacker may choose to release them.
3. The defender may choose to give up a carried item to avoid the hit. For resources move them to the attackers board if there is room or leave them on the board if not. For equipment remove the defenders number token from that card. Now add one for the attacker. If the attacker cannot carry the equipment it is lost.
4. Surrender to the attacker and become **captured**. All other hits are ignored

### Captured

> When a squad is captured flip the squad token to the captured/locked side. Any items the captured squad has remain with the squad but cannot be used. The squad no longer has any actions and automatically moves where its captor moves to. (see **Movement with captives**).

### 5. Coerce

**Captured** squads that are moved to the captor's home base can be coerced into joining the captors faction. For **Lesser Factions** this takes one action, for player factions two. Mark the squad being coerced with a number of coercion block counters, removing one each time a squad in the same base uses an action to coerce them. When there are no more counters next to the squad it becomes a normal faction squad controlled by the captor. While a squad is being coerced it does not count towards rolls and has no actions.

### 6. Construct

A squad equipped with the right tools, resources, and tech can construct defences, parts for the war rig, or facilities by using 1 action. The items and conditions required to construct something are indicated on the card for the item you want to construct.
Resources needed are in the top left of the card and are colour coded.

- 🟥 - volatile materials and fuel sources
- 🟩 - biological material and research obtained from it
- 🟦 - chemicals found in natural gasses and liquid deposits
- 🟫 - heavy elements typically extracted from the ground

The card indicates how many of each type of resource is needed.
Unless otherwise stated any item that grants the holder the construct action e.g. Workshop Tools is the only tool required.
To successfully construct, turn the item face up (if not already), discard the required resources then:

- For equipment add a squad token flipped to the locked side represent additional stock locked in your inventory
- For war rig tech place it in the corresponding slot on the chassis
- For facilities place the card in a facility slot at your home base unless the card states otherwise

#### Stolen items

> If you succeed to steal plans for an item from a Rival Base using the **Espionage** action you may decide to construct it in the normal way at any point by paying the usual resource cost. The card remains in the rival base.

### 7. Fight Fire

A squad at Home Base or with equipment that allows them, can use 1 action to attempt to put out a fire on a site by rolling the white dice:

- 1-3: the fire continues to burn
- 4-6: the fire is successfully put out

Remove the fire token and regenerate half the maximum armour for that site.

## Special Actions

Special locations allow you to perform specific actions there by using 1 action:

### Rival Base

When a squad tries to move in to a rival base of player or lesser factions, squads there try to **Repel** them. If the move is not repelled, the squad is considered infiltrated and have a number of additional actions available to them. Each costs 1 action:

#### 1. Recruit

Roll a the white dice, if the result is higher than the number of enemy squads in the base you manage to convince a squad to leave with you. Treat the recruited squad as **Captured**. After the roll (regardless of the result) the squad is **Repelled** from the base.

#### 2. Rescue

When a squad is **Captured** and returned to the captor's base it begins to be coerced which will take a number of enemy actions. During this time you can try to rescue them providing you have infiltrated the base where they are located. Rescuing works the same as recruitment except if you succeed the squad **Escape**s. Both the rescued and rescuer are **Repelled**.

#### 3. Espionage

Choose one equipment or tech card the rival player owns and look at it and/or turn it face up. In the same action you may attempt to steal plans for the selected item. Roll the green subterfuge dice.

- 🔓 - You break encryption and steal the plans. The item remains where it is but with a squad marker on flipped to the captured/locked side. See the rules on constructing **Stolen Items**. The squad is then **Repelled**.
- 🔗 - your squad is **Captured** and their coercion begins.
- 🚨 - the alarm is raised and all infiltrators (not just your own) are **Repelled**
- 🎯 - your squad is discovered and is attacked as it tries to escape. The normal rules for attack apply if you defend successfully you are still **Repelled**.
- 🟩 - the espionage fails but the squad remains undiscovered

#### 4. Sabotage

Choose one constructed facility or war rig tech currently present in the base. Roll the green subterfuge dice. Follow the result as in **Espionage** except for:

- 🔓 - You break site security and set a timed explosive. All squads you control are **Repelled** from the base then the charge explodes catching **Fire**.

## War Rig

The war rig is the faction's ultimate weapon against rivals but must be built before it can be used by **Gather**ing resources and tech and performing **Construction**.

### Movement

Some items of war rig tech added to the chassis grant movement. The card itself details the type of movement system and three weight tiers the system supports. If the total weight of all the war rig tech on the chassis exceeds what is supported then the war rig cannot move.

### Combat

Some items of war rig tech added to the chassis grant different attacks. The card itself details which dice and how many to attack with at a time. Each dice is colour coded:

#### Blue attack dice - accurate/low damage/special function

🤖 - special function: refer to the card for the weapon that made the attack

#### Red attack dice - mid-accuracy/graded damage/overheat

⚡ - critical hit: refer to the card for the weapon that made the attack
🌫 - overheat: all rolls for this weapon are ignored

#### Black attack dice - inaccurate/high damage/spread effect

💥 - splash damage: choose one additional target in the same location. This attack affects that target as well with the same number of hits.
⚡ - critical hit: refer to the card for the weapon that made the attack
💀 - weapon malfunction: all rolls for the weapon are ignored and it caches fire

#### Targeting

Each attack can target a squad, a facility or another war rig. Squads defend against attacks as in **Squad Attack**. For facilities and war rigs an armour point is deducted for each hit add a hit token to the target. When that target has no armour points left it catches **Fire**.

When targeting another war rig there are multiple parts that can be hit. Roll the white dice to determine which part is the target:

- 1-2: Defender chooses a lower target
- 3-5: Defender chooses an upper target
- 6: Attacker chooses any target

#### Weight Tier

Defending war rigs in a lighter weight tier than their attacker can use their agile movement make the attacker re-roll one attack dice or the **Targeting** dice for each weapon they attack with. If the defender is two tiers lighter they can make the attacker reroll two dice per attack.

## Fire

A war rig part or a facility that is on fire can no longer be used. Place a fire token on the affected site. All effects and abilities the site grants are disabled. Players can **Fight Fire** at home base using a squad action or by using equipment in the field. Every subsequent turn that begins with a site on fire causes damage to all adjacent sites if possible. The damage is equal to half the remaining armour of that site rounded up.

### Adjacency

Sites that are adjacent to others have a link icon between them. For example on the chassis every item is adjacent to the central item.
