# Rules v0.1

## Object

The object of the game is to become the dominant faction. There are 4 ways to do this:

- **Dominate all resources** - control undeniably all 3 resource-rich **Basic Locations**.
- **Peace through power** - tap into abundant, free power in the **Planet Core**.
- **Align with the Empire** - build a warp gate in **Deep Space** to summon the empire.
- **Total Annihilation** - use your War Rig to destroy all other factions.

Each of these has its own path to completion discussed in **End Game** but you will need to build your War Rig to have a chance to achieve any of them.

## End Game

The game ends when any one of these conditions is met:

- A single player has control of all 3 resource locations simultaneously. A player controls a resource when they would win outright any roll to **Repel** other squads from that location.
- All but one player's factions are destroyed. A faction is destroyed when it no longer controls any squads and has no functioning war rig.
- A player discovers and builds either special structure in **Deep Space** or the **Planet Core** satisfying all the requirements on the corresponding cards, then uses it to successfully perform the **Empire Invasion** or to discover **Infinite Power**.

### Empire Invasion

When the empire invades, three drop-ships land random locations chosen by rolling the white dice for each drop-ship. Place the drop-ship in the first location clockwise from the base with the number shown on the dice. If that location already contains a drop-ship choose the next non-base location clockwise from that.

The drop-ships release waves of "suppression squadrons" to capture and convert the squads it considers hostile (all players except the one that summoned the invasion). This starts the moment they land with any hostile squads in drop-ship locations being immediately captured. Each subsequent turn after all player's actions, the suppressors move clockwise to another location skipping over bases, with new ones disembarking the drop-ship as well until all outer areas are held. Squads entering a held area are immediately captured.

After they hold all outer areas the Empire will take the Barren Wastes on the final turn. If this happens the players' bases are discovered by the Empire and the game ends, with the summoning player winning the game.

The only way to stop the Empire is to focus enough fire power on the drop-ships but these are heavily fortified. Drop-ships each have 12 🛡 and return fire whenever attacked. Return fire is rolled on 3 blue attack dice with 🤖 indicating 2 hits on a part of the summoning player's choosing.

As soon as a drop-ship reaches 0 🛡 it is destroyed. Destroy enough drop-ships and the Empire retreats releasing its captives.
For a 2 player game 1 ship must be destroyed, for 3 player 2 ships and for 4 player all three must be destroyed to cause a retreat.

### Infinite Power

Once infinite power has been discovered, destroying its facility has no effect. The player who created the power source is now the **Controller**. They earn political sway by providing the correct power needs to each other faction. Place 2 coercion counters on the base of every player that is **not** the controller to represent the progress of this sway.

At the start of the turn the players and the controller each secretly place a single token numbered 1, 2 or 3 in the facility. Once all players have done this reveal all tokens. If a player's token matches the controller's token then the controller has successfully generated power for their needs and the player can generate resources. The number of resources generated can be up to the number shown on the matched token. The resource can be of any basic resource type and is placed directly in the player's base.

For each successful match the controller removes a coercion counter from the base of the player they matched. When a base has no more coercion counters, it becomes **loyal** to the controller's faction. Those factions can no longer attack each other directly.

If the controller wins enough factions loyalty before anyone else wins the game, then they win.

- 2 - 3 players - 1 faction's loyalty required
- 4 players - 2 faction's loyalty required

## Glossary

### Basic Locations

There are six map locations where basic resources can be gathered
Three tech-rich(T) and three resource-rich (R):

- Ancient City - (T) - known to contain caches of ancient alien tech
- Methane Sea - (R) - an abundant source of chemical materials
- Deep Trenches - (T) - uncover buried tech and access the planet core
- Volcanic Range - (R) - a source of geothermal power and raw materials
- Low Orbit - (T) - find abandoned tech by aerial reconnaissance and access deep space
- Oil Sands - (R) - a rich source of fuel and silicon

### Special Locations

There are various locations for which special rules apply:

- Home Base - your faction's center of operations
- Rival Base - any other base controlled by a player or a **Lesser Faction**
- Planet Core - can only be accessed from Deep Trenches. With the right materials you can construct an infinite power source that will bring a lasting peace.
- Deep Space - can only be accessed from Low Orbit. With the right materials you can construct a warp gate that will bring you an alliance with the empire.
- Barren Wastes - players scavenge for scrap or ambush other players.

### Various

- Lesser Faction - Represent non-player factions that can be more easily recruited to your cause.
- Inventory - an area near each player where they keep tech cards.

## Setup

Place a supply of coloured resource tokens in each location according to the colours printed in that location. Place all other tokens and the tech deck where every one can reach them.

Decide who will go first, 2nd, 3rd etc and sit by the Home Base with that number. Each player starts with the following:

- 1 empty War Rig chassis in their Home Base
- 3 faction squad boards in their Home Base each with number token (1-3) to identify it.
- 1 set of standard issue equipment cards face up in their play area

Assign equipment to your squads in any order by placing numbered tokens on the equipment card that match the squad you want to equip.
Place your remaining 3 faction squad counters (4-6) in a vacant base. These represent the **Lesser Factions**.

## Order of play

The game is played out in a number of turns. In each turn there are a number of rounds determined by the highest number of squads a player controls. Starting with round 1, each player performs 2 actions with squads they control that have the number 1 token. The next round is the same except each player uses squads with the number 2 token. This repeats until there are no more rounds. If in a round a player does not control a squad with that number token play skips past them until a round where they do control a squad. Play repeats for a number of turns until one of the **End Game** conditions is met.

## Basic Actions

### 1. Move

Players can move faction squad by using an action. Every Basic Location and Base is reached via crossing the **Barren Wastes**. For example, to reach the Ancient City in one turn would cost 2 actions for a squad: 1 to reach the wastes and then another to reach the city.
**Special Locations** have their own rules regarding movement

#### Repel

You may attempt to enter any basic location or base, but the squads occupying the same area may attempt to repel your squad if both:

1. They have at least double the squads you have in that area (including the one you are moving in)
2. They roll a number equal or less than the number of squads they have in that area on the white dice.

> Bases always count as if there is one extra repelling squad. Equipment may grant additional bonuses or penalties to this roll.

#### Repelled

> A repelled squad moves back to the Barren Wastes losing any remaining actions it may have had. Each player has just one opportunity to repel any movement attempt.

#### Movement with captives

> If a squad is moving with a squad they have **Captured** and they move to a location other than their Home Base or the Barren Wastes then the captured squad **Escape**s. If the captor moves to Home Base the squad is no longer considered captured but they can be **Corece**d.

#### Escape

> If a squad escapes capture remove any coercion counters. They are [**Repelled**](https://github.com/Ellotron/war-rig/tree/main/rules#repelled) to either the Barren Wastes or if already there to their Home Base. They keep any items they had when captured.

### 2. Gather

A faction squad can gather resources or tech from a basic location by using 1 action. Take one of the available resource tokens and add it to that squad board on a space in the white resource section. That resource is now carried by the squad that gathered it. If however the squad has no free spaces leave it on the board in that location. Any squad can claim this resource for free on their turn.

#### Deposit

Normal and scrap resources are stored in Home Base on arrival. Four scrap can be swapped for one normal resource. A tech resource can be exchanged for a tech card once it is returned to your Home Base. To do this discard the token, take two cards from the tech deck, choose one placing it in your inventory and place the other at the bottom of the deck. Other resources are used in **Construction**. A captive squad can be locked in the cells if they are free and can be [Coerce](https://github.com/Ellotron/war-rig/tree/main/rules#5-coerce)d on subsequent turns. The cells will hold one captive squad at a time.

### 3. Encamp/decamp

A faction squad can camp at location by using an action. While a squad is camped, Place a green camp token on their board in the brown site section. This has the following effects:

- The squad's **Gather** actions allow them to gather 1 additional resource
- A squad counts as 2 for the purposes of repel (equipment can further modify this)
- The squad must spend 1 action to decamp (remove the camp token) before they can move

### 4. Squad Attack

A faction squad may attack another squad when they share the same location. However a squad cannot attack when it is infiltrated in a **Rival Base**.
Squads have 1 offence for each friendly faction in the location. This can be further modified by equipment. For every 2 offence your squad has roll 1 red attack dice.
Similarly the defender has a defence of 1 for each friendly squad in the location plus/minus the effect of any equipment. For each 2 defence roll a brown defence dice.
An unequipped squad cannot roll to attack or defend.

### Attack dice symbols

- 🔺️ - Miss: no effect
- 🎯 - One hit
- 🎯🎯 - Two hits
- 🌫 - Overheat: the squads' weapons overheat. The attack is cancelled and the attacking squad cannot participate in any further attacks this turn
- ⚡ - Backfire: the squad's weapons fail. As with Overheat but the squad also suffers a hit.

### Defence dice symbols

- 🟫 - no effect
- 🛡 - one dodge: negates a hit
- 🛡🛡 - two dodge: negates two hits

For each remaining 🎯 after subtracting each 🛡 resolve a hit. A squad that has been hit can, in this order:

1. Use any equipment carried by a friendly squad in that area that begins "When attacked".
2. If the defender has a captured squad the attacker may choose to release them.
3. The defender may choose to give up a carried item to avoid the hit. For resources move them to the attackers board if there is room or leave them on the board if not. For equipment remove the defenders number token from that card. Now add one for the attacker. If the attacker cannot carry the equipment it is lost.
4. Surrender to the attacker and become **captured**. All other hits are ignored

### Captured

> When a squad is captured flip the squad token to the captured/locked side. Any items the captured squad has remain with the squad but cannot be used. The squad no longer has any actions and automatically moves where its captor moves to. (see **Movement with captives**).

### 5. Coerce

**Captured** squads that are moved to the captor's home base can be coerced into joining the captors faction. For **Lesser Factions** this takes two actions, for player factions three. Mark the squad being coerced with a number of coercion block counters, removing one each time a squad in the same base uses an action to coerce them. When there are no more counters next to the squad it becomes a normal faction squad controlled by the captor. While a squad is being coerced it does not count towards rolls and has no actions.

### 6. Construct

A squad equipped with the right tools, resources, and tech can construct defences, parts for the war rig, or facilities in their inventory by using 1 action. The items and conditions required to construct something are indicated on the card for the item you want to construct.
Resources needed are in the top left of the card and are colour coded.

- 🟥 - volatile materials and fuel sources
- 🟩 - biological material and research obtained from it
- 🟦 - chemicals found in natural gasses and liquid deposits
- 🟫 - heavy elements typically extracted from the ground

The card indicates how many of each type of resource is needed.
Unless otherwise stated any item that grants the holder the construct action e.g. Workshop Tools is the only tool required.
To successfully construct, turn the item face up (if not already), discard the required resources then assign it.

#### Assign

You can only assign to a squad, or rig when it is in Home Base. You can only construct a facility in the location printed on the card.

- For equipment add a squad token flipped to the locked side represent additional stock locked in your inventory. This can be replaced with a numbered token matching a squad you wish to equip when that squad is in Home Base. Equipping a squad does not cost an action.
- For war rig tech place it in the corresponding slot on the chassis
- For facilities place the card in a facility slot at your home base unless the card states otherwise

#### Stolen items

> If you succeed to steal plans for an item from a Rival Base using the **Espionage** action you may decide to construct it at any point by paying the usual resource cost. Equipment cards remain in the rival base with a locked squad token on them. You must still construct equipment before you can flip this token or gain additional inventory as described above. Other tech is constructed in the normal way.

### 7. Fight Fire

A squad at Home Base or with equipment that allows them, can use 1 action to attempt to put out a fire on a site by rolling the white dice:

- 1-3: the fire continues to burn
- 4-6: the fire is successfully put out

Remove the fire token and regenerate half the maximum armour for that site.

## Special Actions

Special locations allow you to perform specific actions there by using 1 action:

### Rival Base

When a squad tries to move in to a rival base of player or lesser factions, squads there try to **Repel** them. If the move is not repelled, the squad is considered infiltrated. Infiltrated squads cannot attack or be attacked but have a number of additional actions available to them. Each costs 1 action:

#### 1. Recruit

Roll a the white dice, if the result is higher than the number of enemy squads in the base you manage to convince a squad to leave with you. Treat the recruited squad as **Captured**. After the roll (regardless of the result) the squad is [**Repelled**](https://github.com/Ellotron/war-rig/tree/main/rules#repelled) from the base.

#### 2. Rescue

When a squad is **Captured** and returned to the captor's base it begins to be coerced which will take a number of enemy actions. During this time you can try to rescue them providing you have infiltrated the base where they are located. Rescuing works the same as recruitment except if you succeed the squad **Escape**s. Both the rescued and rescuer are [**Repelled**](https://github.com/Ellotron/war-rig/tree/main/rules#repelled).

#### 3. Espionage

Choose one equipment or tech card in the rival player's inventory and look at it and/or turn it face up. In the same action you may attempt to steal plans for the selected item. Roll the green subterfuge dice.

- 🔓 - You break encryption and steal the plans. If the item is equipment leave the card in the rival base and add a locked squad token to it. For any other tech move the card to your inventory. The squad is then [**Repelled**](https://github.com/Ellotron/war-rig/tree/main/rules#repelled).
- 🔗 - your squad is **Captured** and can now be **Coerce**d.
- 🚨 - the alarm is raised and all infiltrators (not just your own) are [**Repelled**](https://github.com/Ellotron/war-rig/tree/main/rules#repelled)
- 🎯 - your squad is discovered and is attacked as it tries to escape. The normal rules for **Squad Attack** apply if you defend successfully you are still [**Repelled**](https://github.com/Ellotron/war-rig/tree/main/rules#repelled).
- 🟩 - the espionage fails but the squad remains undiscovered

> You cannot steal parts that are attached to the war rig or facilities that have been constructed.

#### 4. Sabotage

Choose one constructed facility or war rig tech currently present in the base. Roll the green subterfuge dice. Follow the result as in **Espionage** except for:

- 🔓 - You break site security and set a timed explosive. All squads you control are [**Repelled**](https://github.com/Ellotron/war-rig/tree/main/rules#repelled) from the base then the charge explodes catching **Fire**.

## War Rig

The war rig is the faction's ultimate weapon against rivals but must be built before it can be used by **Gather**ing resources and tech and performing **Construction**.

Once an item is constructed it can be attached only when the war-rig chassis is in Home Base. Each item attached to the rig adds weight which affects the **movement** of the rig.

### Movement

Some items of war rig tech added to the chassis grant movement. The card itself details the type of movement system and three weight tiers the system supports.
If the rig's total weight is less than or equal to every "Light" tier printed on attached items then the rig is in the light tier. Likewise for "Medium" and "Heavy" tiers.

However if the total weight of all the war rig tech on the chassis exceeds any "Heavy" tier then the war rig cannot move. Being in a lighter tier is beneficial in combat.

#### Crash

Certain card effects can cause a rig to crash. If a rig crashes it suffers massive damage. For each attached part roll the white dice:

- 1: The part catches fire
- 2-3: The part loses half it remaining armour
- 4-6: The part loses 1 armour

### Targeting

In order to attack a squad, a facility or another war rig you must target them. This can only be done if the rig has the **Targeting** ability granted by various tech items.

When targeting another war rig there are multiple parts that can be hit. Roll the white dice to determine which part is the target:

- 1-2: Defender chooses a lower target
- 3-5: Defender chooses an upper target
- 6: Attacker chooses any target

### Attack

Some items of war rig tech added to the chassis grant different attacks which can be performed in any order. The card itself details which dice and how many to attack with at a time.

Squads defend against attacks as in **Squad Attack** except instead of surrender they are destroyed and removed from the game. For facilities and war rigs an armour point is deducted for each hit add a hit token to the target. When that target has no armour points left it catches **Fire**.

Each dice is colour coded, has a number of 🎯 faces which indicate one or more hit and also some special faces:

#### Dice Type

- Blue attack dice - accurate/low damage/special function
  - 🤖 - special function: refer to the card for the weapon that made the attack
- Red attack dice - mid-accuracy/graded damage/overheat
  - ⚡ - critical hit: refer to the card for the weapon that made the attack
  - 🌫 - overheat: all rolls for this weapon are ignored
- Black attack dice - inaccurate/high damage/spread effect
  - 💥 - splash damage: choose one additional target in the same location. This attack affects that target as well with the same number of hits.
  - ⚡ - critical hit: refer to the card for the weapon that made the attack
  - 💀 - weapon malfunction: all rolls for the weapon are ignored and it caches fire

#### Agility

Defending war rigs in a lighter weight tier than their attacker can use their agile movement make the attacker re-roll one attack dice or the **Targeting** dice for each weapon they attack with. If the defender is two tiers lighter they can make the attacker reroll two dice per attack.

## Fire

A war rig part or a facility that is on fire can no longer be used. Place a fire token on the affected site. All effects and abilities the site grants are disabled. Players can **Fight Fire** at home base using a squad action or by using equipment in the field. Every subsequent turn that begins with a site on fire causes damage to all adjacent sites if possible. The damage is equal to half the remaining armour of that site rounded up.

> Sites that are adjacent to others have a link icon between them. For example on the chassis every item is adjacent to the central item.
